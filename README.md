# Ideation and Problem-Solving Lab

It's time to come up with some great app ideas. These ideas can be just practice, or they can be the start of a new personal project, or they can be used for group projects, a hackathon, or an open source project.

A list of possible app ideas will be handy, so even if you have a great idea but can't use it right away, it can still be utilized later.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. When applicable, please add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

Answer the following questions for at least one idea:

- Give a brief summary of your idea.

> An app that tracks the lifecycle of a product from manufactured date to the time it is disposed.

- Who is this product for? Describe the type of person or community this application is for.

> This app is mainly for the everyday consumer who wants to know the condition of their product. If it's new, or refurbished. It can also be used for manufacturing companies that want to know their product's lifespan. 

- What problem does it solve?

> Ever wonder if an electronic device you ordered off Amazon was previously used or returned by some other consumer? Do you want to know more about the previous user, and how they handled this product? This app tracks a product's usage, condition, date of manufacture, if it passed its warranty etc.

- Why is this problem important?

> It's important because it reveals information about a product's life and helps consumers make smarter sales decisions when purchasing products. 

- How will this application solve the problem?

> This application will solve the issue of determining whether a product you bought functions, and confirms the condition it's in. Was the item faulty/defective and refurbished? The consumer has the right to know.

- What are customers currently doing to solve the problem?

> Consumers are relying heavily on customer reviews, which most times are not genuine and are written by paid reviewers. There is no direct place to find out what happened to an open-box product, or products sold second hand on websites like eBay etc. Customers have lack of information about products and rely on social media personalities or unreliable recommendations to purchase products. 

- How does it compare to the alternatives?

> There aren't any apps out there that detail a product's condition, how many consumers have owned it, if it has been repaired, still under warranty etc. The software that is available are for sales purposes, forecasting how well a product will do, and deal with more product and market analysis.
