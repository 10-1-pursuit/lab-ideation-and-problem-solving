- What problem does it solve?

> It can help solve difficulty in tracking & scheduling vet appointments as well as managing medication & treatment plans for pets. 

- Why is this problem important?

> Access to organized health records, timely veterinary care, and reliable information can significantly impact the quality a pet's life. Users can set medication schedules and receive reminders for their pets' medications.
