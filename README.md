# Ideation and Problem-Solving Lab

It's time to come up with some great app ideas. These ideas can be just practice, or they can be the start of a new personal project, or they can be used for group projects, a hackathon, or an open source project.

A list of possible app ideas will be handy, so even if you have a great idea but can't use it right away, it can still be utilized later.

## Getting Started

## Instructions

Answer the following questions for at least one idea:

- Give a brief summary of your idea.

> Your answer here...

    Tugo: An app that at the press of a button or previously set timer, pulls up a fake call or shoots off a message to a selected contact for when you need to get out of a bad date, conversation with a coworker you tolerate, or a conversation about politics from your drunk uncle you weren't prepared to have. Meant to be accessible from app or from notification screen on your device.

- Who is this product for? Describe the type of person or community this application is for.

> Your answer here...
    Though marketable to many, this definitely is marketed towards femme and queer communities who need a discrete way of leaving a bad situation without setting off whoever they're with.

- What problem does it solve?

> Your answer here...
    Instead of waiting for a time to call someone or contact someone for assistance in leaving a conversation/date/etc- the app can set up an delayed notice to a contact or a fake call in order to justify exiting, but subtly.

- Why is this problem important?

> Your answer here...
    There have and always will be bad dates, some that people wished they left earlier than others. Offensive conversations that were had, that could've been avoided. But in this age where there's a very troubling machismo "alpha" mentality, people tend to stay in these situations out of fear of danger or repercussion for leaving.

- How will this application solve the problem?

> Your answer here...
   It won't. But it can assist alleviating some of the pressure there. Giving exit options to people who need them and possibly offering emergency assistance/location service options for sake of safety and access.  

- What are customers currently doing to solve the problem?

> Your answer here...
    Some people fake calls, some people go up to other people, some people message their friends while their date is in the bathroom.

- How does it compare to the alternatives?

> Your answer here...
    The app is intended to be subtle, so you're not texting away at someone for an exit strategy. With a glance at your home screen (and a tap), you can have a call come to you shortly so you can get out.
